about=This plugin exports all vector layers as geoJson with their SLD styling. Active raster layers are exported according to their position in the layer stack as multiband GeoTIFFs (This also goes for basemap tiles so you might want to uncheck basemap layers before exporting). The resulting files are zipped into a file named after the QGIS project. The layer order and additional information is stored in a metadata.json.
